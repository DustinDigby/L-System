# L-System
Using the L-System algortihm for my Linear Data Structures course

The program invloved using queues for the first time. This project read in up to five different equations and could then expand each one a number of times up to 20.
The user can set the start symbol and then the expansion would depend on the equations written in.
The final equation after the number of expansions will draw a line with different directions in the GUI.
